# Cataract_Eye_Classification_Using_CNN
This repository contains the code for detecting cataracts in eye pictures with deep learning algorithms. The goal is to create a model that can properly recognize cataracts in medical photos, allowing for early diagnosis and treatment.
# Introduction
Cataracts are the primary cause of blindness worldwide. Early detection is critical to effective treatment. This study use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to create a model capable of classifying eye images as having cataracts or not.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link:

The model architecture is built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It uses numerous layers of convolutions, pooling, and thick layers to extract features and perform classifications. The model.py file has a full architectural description.
# Results
This model achieved an accuracy of 95.86% by using modified vgg16 architecture during the testing phase.
